              Keira Christina Knightley was born March 26, 1985 in the South
              West Greater London suburb of Richmond. She is the daughter of
              actor Will Knightley and actress turned playwright Sharman
              Macdonald. An older brother, Caleb Knightley, was born in 1979.
              Her father is English, while her Scottish-born mother is of
              Scottish and Welsh origin. Brought up immersed in the acting
              profession from both sides - writing and performing - it is little
              wonder that the young Keira asked for her own agent at the age of
              three. She was granted one at the age of six and performed in her
              first TV role as "Little Girl" in Royal Celebration (1993), aged
              seven.

              David Matthew Macfadyen was born in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, to
              Meinir (Owen), a drama teacher and actress, and Martin Macfadyen,
              an oil executive. He is of Scottish and Welsh descent. Because of
              his father's career, he spent at least part of his childhood in
              Indonesia, before finishing his education back in England and
              winning a place at RADA in 1992. He won critical acclaim in the UK
              with his work with the stage company Cheek By Jowl in the 1990s
              and was well established as a stage actor when he made his first
              TV appearance in Wuthering Heights (1998). A couple more TV roles
              followed but it was his role as Tom Quinn, head of Section D, in
              the hit BBC series MI-5 (2002) that really made his name at home.
              And, indeed, established his home - he met his wife, Keeley Hawes,
              while working on the show. A steady stream of TV and film work
              followed, with his performance as Mr Darcy in Pride & Prejudice
              (2005) firmly establishing his name worldwide.

              After forty years of hard work on stage and both television and
              film, there are not many other actresses who deserved the success,
              recognition and stardom which Brenda Blethyn has now achieved.
              Born in 1946 in Ramsgate, Kent, England, she started her career at
              British Rail in the 1960s. Saving money during her time there, she
              took a risk and enrolled herself at the at The Guildford School of
              Acting in Guildford, Surrey, England and then left her British
              Rail years behind. Her risk had paid off, by the mid-1970s she was
              working on stage, eventually joining the National Theatre Company
              in 1975.
