          <p class="fs-3">
            This film is the story of the Bennet family, a middle-class family
            in England around 1800. The principal characters are:
          </p>
          <p class="fs-3">
            Mrs. Bennet (Brenda Blethyn), a hyperexcitable woman obsessed with
            getting at least one of her daughters into a financially
            advantageous marriage.
          </p>
          <p class="fs-3">
            Mr. Bennet (Donald Sutherland), who is relaxed, easygoing, and
            unflappable. He is somewhat amused by the high-spirited behavior of
            the rest of the family.
          </p>
          <p class="fs-3">
            Jane (Rosamund Pike), the oldest of the daughters. She is serious
            and thoughtful, but quite shy.
          </p>
          <p class="fs-3">
            Elizabeth (Lizzie) (Keira Knightley), the second daughter and the
            main character. She is wise, witty, and outspoken. She enjoys (and
            is very good at) verbal sparring and skirmishing with people.
          </p>
          <p class="fs-3">
            Mary (Talulah Riley), the third, not at all socially outgoing or
            interested in chasing men. She spends her time reading, playing the
            piano, and speaking of how much more interesting nature is than
            human society.
          </p>
          <p class="fs-3">
            Katherine (Kitty) (Carey Mulligan), like Lydia, is a boy-crazy
            teenager. The two of them are not interested in any serious
            pursuits; they just want to go to parties and dances. Kitty is
            impressionable and takes her cues from Lydia.
          </p>
          <p class="fs-3">
            Lydia (Jena Malone) is even more frivolous than Kitty.
          </p>
          <p class="fs-3">
            Charles Bingley (Simon Woods) is a wealthy and good-natured
            gentleman from London who moves into a nearby estate, causing great
            interest among the Bennets.
          </p>
          <p class="fs-3">
            Fitzwilliam Darcy (Matthew Macfadyen) is an extremely wealthy
            gentleman from the North of England. Unfortunately, he is
            ill-at-ease and inarticulate in social situations. He does not
            express himself well, and creates a bad impression on people.
          </p>
          <p class="fs-3">
            The reason that an advantageous marriage is important is that the
            house and land are covered by a covenant that would give it to the
            eldest male heir on Mr. Bennet's death, but, having no sons, it will
            go to their cousin, William Collins. This would leave the family
            destitute.
          </p>
          <p class="fs-3"></p>
          <p class="fs-3">
            The film opens with a tracking shot of a green covered field on a
            sun-lit morning. Elizabeth "Lizzie" Bennet walks along the field
            finishing a book. Upon coming home, she overhears her mother telling
            her father excitedly that Netherfield, a nearby estate, has been
            rented by a Mr. Bingley, a wealthy gentleman from London. Mrs.
            Bennet begs Mr. Bennet to call on Mr. Bingley, believing him to be a
            very suitable match for any of her daughters. Mr. Bennett finally
            divulges that he has already met Mr. Bingley--he enjoys playing his
            low-key detached persona off of his wife's hyper-excitablility. When
            he says that they can all expect to see Mr. Bingley at an upcoming
            public ball, all of the Bennet daughters (who had been listening
            intently at the keyhole) squeal in excitement. Lizzie herself and
            the eldest sister Jane smile with pleasure, as the younger Lydia and
            Kitty jump up and down, and immediately begin to beg Jane to borrow
            her prettiest pair of shoes. Mary merely goes back to playing her
            piano. As Mr. Bennet leaves his study and sees that the five girls
            were all listening, he simply walks past them, amusedly saying "Good
            heavens! People!"
